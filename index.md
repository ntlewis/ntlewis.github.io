### About 

I am a postgraduate student at the University of Oxford, studying towards a DPhil in Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics under the supervision of Professor Peter Read. 

At present, my main research interest is understanding the large-scale dynamics of Solar System and exo-planetary atmospheres, and my DPhil project is focussed on super-rotation in terrestrial atmospheres. I have a general interest in the full range of topics falling under the umbrella of 'Geophysical Fluid Dynamics'.

Before arriving in Oxford I studied Mathematics at the University of Exeter, where I obtained an MSci Mathematics degree (first class). I completed my masters dissertation under the supervision of Professor Geoff Vallis. I spent my formative years at Sir Thomas Rich’s School, Gloucester. 

Having grown up in the Cotswolds, I am very fond of the outdoors and enjoy walking in my spare time. I also enjoy drawing, and I’m a keen squash player (although I’m not very good).

#### Research focus

The focus of my current research concerns understanding the atmosphere of Venus. My aim is to develop a Venusian configuration of the Isca modelling framework developed at the University of Exeter. This model will be built both from existing components of the previous Oxford Venus GCM (OPUS-Vr), and new components currently under development, such as a representation of radiatively interactive clouds and hazes.
