# I am a postgraduate student at the University of Oxford, studying towards a DPhil in Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics under the supervision of Prof. Peter Read. Before arriving in Oxford, I studied Mathematics at the University of Exeter where I obtained a first degree in MSci Mathematics (Climate Science). Whilst in Exeter, I completed a masters research project under the supervision of Prof. Geoff Vallis.  

#### Research focus

The focus of my current research concerns understanding the atmosphere of Venus. My aim is to develop a Venusian configuration of the Isca modelling framework developed at the University of Exeter. This model will be built both from existing components of the previous Oxford Venus GCM (OPUS-Vr), and new components currently under development, such as a representation of radiatively interactive clouds and hazes.
